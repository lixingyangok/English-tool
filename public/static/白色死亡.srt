1
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:21,860
白色死亡

2
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:23,820
White Death

00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,220
Chapter 1

4
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:40,800
The woman stood in front of the prison

5
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:48,560
The prison was a big dirty building in the biggest town of a hot country

6
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:52,440
The woman was very hot

7
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:58,400
And she did not like the noise, from all the cars in the road

8
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,800
She was an English woman

9
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:07,720
And she did not like hot countries, or a lot of noise

10
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:13,240
She was tall about 50 years old

11
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:17,160
With blue eyes and a long face

12
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:24,040
Her face was red, and She looked tired and angry

13
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:28,170
She knocked at the door of the prison

14
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:33,400
For a long time nothing happened

15
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:39,050
Then a little window opened in the door

16
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:42,400
And a man looked out at her

17
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:46,240
"Yes, what do you want?"

18
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:52,640
"I want to see my daughter, It's very important"

19
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,240
"Name?"

20
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,760
"Anna Harland"

21
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:01,560
"Is that your name? or your daughter's name?"

22
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,240
"It's my name"

23
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:08,760
"My daughter's name is Sarah Harland"

24
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,420
"You can't visit her today"

25
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:15,640
"Come back on Wednesday"

26
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:21,800
"No I came from England to see her today"

27
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:27,520
"It's very important, She's going to court tomorrow"

28
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:32,400
"Please take me to her, now"

29
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,160
"Wait a minute"

30
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:39,000
The little window closed

31
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:42,160
But the door did not open

32
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:48,640
The woman waited in front of the door for a long time

33
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:53,200
A lot of people in the road looked at her

34
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,880
One or two young men laughed

35
00:02:57,770 --> 00:02:59,720
But she did not move

36
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:05,850
She stood there in the hot road, in front of the prison door

37
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:07,480
And waited

38
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,400
After 20 minutes, the door opened

39
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:17,920
"Come with me" the man said

40
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:21,120
The woman went in with him

41
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,800
It was dark in the prison

42
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:29,480
And at first, she could not see very well

43
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:35,520
She walked for a long time, past hundreds of doors

44
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,480
Then the man opened one of them

45
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,960
"In here" he said

46
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:46,240
"You can have 10 minutes"

47
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:50,770
Anna Harland walked into the room

48
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:54,280
And the man went in after her

49
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:58,420
He closed the door behind him

50
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:04,960
There was a table in the room, and two chairs

51
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:11,280
On one of the chairs sat her daughter Sarah

52
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:20,440
She was a tall girl, about 19 years old, with big blue eyes

53
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:23,960
"Mother!" she said

54
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:27,320
"I'm very happy to see you"

55
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,080
And she got up

56
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:34,680
And began to run across the room to her mother

57
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:41,280
"Sarah" Anna said. And Put out her arms

58
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:47,760
But the man moved quickly, and stood between them

59
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,560
"No!" he said to Anna

60
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:56,240
"I'm sorry, I know you are her mother"

61
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:00,760
"You can talk, but that's all"

62
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:05,000
"Please sit down at the table"

63
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,320
"I am here, to watch you"

64
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:14,960
The mother and daughter sat down at the table

65
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:21,240
Anna's hands were near Sarah's on the table

66
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:26,200
She looked carefully at her daughter

67
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,440
Sarah's dress and face were dirty

68
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:38,040
"She's tired and unhappy" Anna thought

69
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:43,840
"Sarah, what happened?" she said

70
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:49,520
"We have 10 minutes to talk, no more"

71
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,840
"Tell me please quickly"

72
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,800
"I want to help you"

73
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,720
Sarah looked at her mother

74
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:06,680
"Oh mother I'm happy you are here"

75
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,880
"I wanted you to come"

76
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:15,080
"Mother I... I didn't do it"

77
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:20,120
"It isn't true, please believe me"

78
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,400
"Of course, I believe you. Sarah"

79
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:30,840
"But tell me about it, what happened?"

80
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:35,320
"Quickly begin at the beginning"

81
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:41,240
"Yes, but... I don't know"

82
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:46,160
"When did it begin, I don't know"

83
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:49,680
"I don't understand it"

84
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:54,200
"Why did the police arrest you?"

85
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,920
"When did they bring you to this prison?"

86
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:04,680
"Last week, I think. Yes, last week"

87
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:09,360
"At the airport when we arrived"

88
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:15,000
"The police stopped us, and looked in our bags"

89
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,440
"Then..." Sarah looked down at the table

90
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:26,800
"She's crying" Anna thought "She's very unhappy"

91
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:33,760
"What happened then, Sarah?" her mother asked

92
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:40,960
"They, They said there were drugs in my bag"

93
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:48,840
"Then they took me into a room, and told me to take my dress off"

94
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:55,680
"They looked for more drugs, but they found nothing"

95
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:00,640
"Then... Then they brought me here"

96
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:07,640
"I see, where were the drugs then?"

97
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,920
"Where did they find them?"

98
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:17,960
"Oh, they didn't tell you" Sarah stopped crying

99
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:24,000
She looked up, and there was a smile on her face

100
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,520
But, it was not a happy smile

101
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:34,760
"The drugs were in a tube of toothpaste"

102
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:39,480
"A toothpaste tube with drugs in it"

103
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:44,080
"Heroin, not toothpaste"

104
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,920
"And you didn't know about it"

105
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:53,440
"No mother, Of course not"

106
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:58,520
"Do you think I clean my teeth with heroin"

107
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,280
Anna Harland smiled

108
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:07,840
It was difficult to smile because she was afraid

109
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:13,480
But she smiled, because she wanted to help her daughter

110
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:19,680
"I know you don't clean your teeth with heroin"

111
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:23,680
"You have very good teeth Sarah"

112
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:28,080
"But, what about Stephen?"

113
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,840
"Did he know about the heroin?"

114
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:36,320
"Did he put it in the toothpaste tube?"

115
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,600
"Stephen? No"

116
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:44,880
"Why do you ask about Stephen, mother?"

117
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:49,760
"Well, is he in prison too?"

118
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:55,200
"You said 'us', and 'our' bags"

119
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,840
"Did the police arrest him too?"

120
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:02,040
"Oh no"

121
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,720
Sarah's face was unhappy

122
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:11,400
"No, I wasn't with Stephen mother"

123
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:16,180
"You see, Stephen and I..."

124
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:20,440
"Well... We aren't friends now"

125
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:25,120
"I left him about two months ago"

126
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:29,080
"And then I met Hassan"

127
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,200
"Hassan?"

128
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:36,920
"Yes, I was with Hassan at the airport"

129
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:43,720
"Stephen was on the plane too, I don't know why"

130
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:51,920
"But he wasn't with me. It's Hassan, he was with me"

131
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:57,760
"Hassan's important to me now, not Stephen"

132
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:04,360
Anna looked at her daughter "I see"

133
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:09,840
"And did the police arrest this Hassan too?"

134
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,280
"Is he in prison?"

135
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,800
"Yes, he is"

136
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:21,360
"They arrested him, but I can't see him"

137
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:26,360
"I asked them, I wanted to see him"

138
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,280
"But they said no"

139
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:36,600
"Mother, I'm sure Hassan didn't know about the heroin"

140
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:43,760
"He's a good man, He didn't know, I'm sure"

141
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:49,600
"Then why was the heroin in your bag, Sarah?"

142
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:55,960
"I don't know mother, I don't know"

143
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,960
The man looked at the clock in the room

144
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:05,740
"I'm sorry Mrs Harland" he said

145
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:11,280
"But that's 10 minutes. It's time to go"

146
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,240
"Anna Harland stood up slowly"

147
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:20,560
"Alright" she said

148
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:24,520
"But don't be afraid" Sarah

149
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:28,840
"I'm coming to the court tomorrow"

150
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:35,320
"Yes mother" Sarah said "Thank you"

151
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:41,840
"The police are bringing Hassan to court tomorrow too. I think"

152
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,200
"You can see him there"

153
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,560
"He's a good man mother"

154
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:54,440
"And... I'm sure he didn't know about the drugs"

155
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:59,080
"Perhaps" Anna said

156
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:02,440
She walked slowly to the door

157
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:08,560
And then stood by the door, and looked at her daughter again

158
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:15,800
"Sarah, you are telling me the truth, aren't you?"

159
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:20,040
Sarah began to cry again

160
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:23,880
"Yes mother, of course I am"

161
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:29,000
"I always tell you the truth, you know that"

162
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:35,310
Anna smiled "Yes Sarah"

163
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:41,560
She said quietly "Yes I believe you"

164
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:48,760
She went through the door, and the man went out after her

165
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:57,840
Sarah sat quietly at the table in the room, and looked at her hands

166
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:05,520
"Yes" she thought "I told you the truth, mother"

167
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,160
"I always tell you the truth"

168
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:14,240
"But I didn't tell you everything"

169
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:19,480
She put her head in her hands

170
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:34,060
-

171
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,940
Chapter 2

172
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:44,200
Anna Harland left the prison, and went to talk to the police

173
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:50,480
She waited a long time, in a small office

174
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:57,120
But after an hour, a policeman came into the room

175
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:03,960
He was a big man, about 55 years old

176
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:08,360
With brown eyes and a nice smile

177
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:13,480
He moved very slowly and quietly

178
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:20,400
"Good afternoon, Mrs Harland" he said

179
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:25,720
"My name is Detective Inspector Aziz"

180
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:31,960
"I arrested your daughter three days ago"

181
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,040
"I'm very sorry for you"

182
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:42,600
"This is a very unhappy thing for a mother"

183
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:50,020
"It's a very unhappy thing for my daughter, Inspector"

184
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,720
Anna said angrily

185
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:59,800
"Because she didn't do it, she's innocent you know"

186
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,800
"She knows nothing about those drugs"

187
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:13,120
Detective inspector Aziz looked at her carefully for a minute

188
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:18,000
He did not know many English women

189
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:24,160
"She has an interesting face" he thought

190
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:29,400
"Very blue eyes and a long nose"

191
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:36,200
"She is not afraid of me, and she is not crying"

192
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,400
"Perhaps she wants to know the truth"

193
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:46,880
"Perhaps she can help me too"

194
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:54,040
"Well, Mrs Harland" he said slowly

195
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:57,520
"It's difficult for me"

196
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:02,040
"Is your daughter telling the truth?"

197
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,400
"Is she innocent?"

198
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:11,480
"Because the drugs were in her bag you know"

199
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:16,480
"I know" Anna said

200
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:22,320
"But she was with a young man, Hassan"

201
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:27,200
"She doesn't know him very well, I think"

202
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:33,240
"Tell me about him please, I want to know"

203
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:38,560
Inspector Aziz smiled

204
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,880
"All right" he said

205
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:47,400
"But first, tell me about your daughter"

206
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,760
"Why was she on that plane?"

207
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:57,880
"Why did she come to this country? tell me"

208
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:02,140
Anna Harland looked at him

209
00:18:03,170 --> 00:18:06,880
"He's a nice man" she thought

210
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,800
"He listens to people"

211
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:13,280
"Perhaps he wants to help"

212
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:18,160
"Perhaps he can understand Sarah"

213
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:24,760
"Do you have daughters?" she asked

214
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:30,320
"Yes" The Inspector answered "two"

215
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:36,600
"Then perhaps you can understand" Anna said

216
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:40,040
"Sarah is 19"

217
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:44,160
"She finished school last year"

218
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:50,920
"And she worked for 6 months in a hospital, to get some money"

219
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:58,480
"Then she and her boyfriend Stephen visited a lot of countries"

220
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:04,800
"They went to Greece, Turkey, India, Australia"

221
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,760
"And now they are here"

222
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:13,910
"They are young, and they want to see new countries"

223
00:19:14,050 --> 00:19:19,440
"And new towns and new people, that's all"

224
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,880
"I see" the Inspector said

225
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:33,840
"But sometimes, young people do things, bad things"

226
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:37,220
"Because they are in a different country"

227
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:39,800
"And they need money"

228
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:46,680
"Not Sarah" Anna said "And not heroin"

229
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:54,080
"Sarah worked in a hospital and she knows about heroin"

230
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:58,000
"She knows it can kill people"

231
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:05,240
"I'm a doctor, and she wants to be a doctor too"

232
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:10,960
"I see" Inspector said again

233
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:17,280
He looked at her and thought, but he said nothing

234
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:25,960
"Now" Anna said "tell me about this young man Hassan"

235
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:30,840
"Alright" the inspector said

236
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:37,880
He took some papers from the table, and began to read to her

237
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:43,320
"But we don't know very much about him"

238
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:48,920
"He's a rich boy, from a good family"

239
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:54,640
"His father has two or three shops I think"

240
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,720
"And the police in his town know him too"

241
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:06,880
"Last year his father gave him a new car"

242
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:13,240
"A very fast car, and listen to this..."

243
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:17,400
"One day he hit a police car"

244
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:24,480
"And the police car went into the river, what a story"

245
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:30,040
"His father bought a new car for the police"

246
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:34,360
"His father has a lot of money"

247
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:41,480
The Inspector smiled, but Anna looked unhappy

248
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:47,680
"Oh dear" she said "that's not very good"

249
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:53,040
"No" he said "It isn't good"

250
00:21:53,720 --> 00:22:01,680
"But this story about the heroin is worse, much worse"

251
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:05,440
"I don't like this story"

252
00:22:06,264 --> 00:22:21,440
-

253
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,160
Chapter 3

254
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:29,840
Next morning, Anna Harland went to the court

255
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,880
She was first there

256
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:38,320
She sat in the courtroom, and waited

257
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:46,640
A lot of people came in, and she saw a man and his wife

258
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:53,720
"Perhaps they are Hassan's father and mother" Anna thought

259
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:58,240
But she did not want to talk to them

260
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:05,600
The lawyers came in next, with a lot of papers

261
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:12,920
They sat at a table in front of her, and talked quietly

262
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:21,480
"Those two lawyers" Anna thought "They are old friends"

263
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:26,960
"But one of them, wants my daughter to die"

264
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:31,120
"And one wants her to be free"

265
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:41,960
After the lawyers the jury came in, twelve people men and women

266
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:47,600
They sat down and watched the lawyers

267
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:55,160
They looked at Anna, and then talked quietly about her

268
00:23:57,320 --> 00:24:03,360
"These people don't look very important" she thought

269
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:08,600
"But they are the most important people here"

270
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:13,740
"There are going to say 'she did it'"

271
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:17,800
"Or, 'she didn't do it'"

272
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:25,760
"And then Sarah comes home to me, or she dies"

273
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:30,560
She watched their faces carefully

274
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:36,760
Then some policemen came in

275
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:43,880
Inspector Aziz saw Anna and smiled at her

276
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:48,220
But Anna did not talk to him

277
00:24:49,170 --> 00:24:53,440
Because Sarah came in at the same time

278
00:24:54,840 --> 00:25:00,400
She looked afraid, and her face was very white

279
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:06,680
She looked across the courtroom saw her mother

280
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:10,840
And gave her an unhappy smile

281
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:16,840
There were two policemen behind Sarah

282
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:21,080
But Anna did not looked at them

283
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:30,360
She looked at the tall dark young man next to Sarah, Hassan

284
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:37,600
"He's about 20 years old" Anna thought

285
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:44,400
"He's very tall, but he has a nice face"

286
00:25:45,050 --> 00:25:48,540
"And very beautiful dark eyes"

287
00:25:49,850 --> 00:25:55,450
Sarah likes him, and I can understand that

288
00:25:57,100 --> 00:26:03,750
But he looks very unhappy too, and afraid

289
00:26:04,650 --> 00:26:08,150
His hands are moving all the time

290
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:14,310
Hassan looked at Sarah and smiled

291
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:18,200
She smiled back at him

292
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:22,710
Anna wanted to talk to Sarah

293
00:26:23,310 --> 00:26:27,400
But just then, a policeman said loudly:

294
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,450
"All stand please!"

295
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:37,300
Everybody stood up and the judge came into the courtroom

296
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:42,500
He went to his chair, and sat down

297
00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:48,000
The police lawyer began

298
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:58,400
"These two young people, came into our country last week" he said

299
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,420
"The young man lives in this country"

300
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:06,850
"And the young woman is English"

301
00:27:08,350 --> 00:27:13,850
"At the airport, the police looked in their bags"

302
00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:19,850
"And they found three tubes of toothpaste"

303
00:27:20,350 --> 00:27:24,100
"These tubes of toothpaste"

304
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:32,650
He had the three tubes in his hand, and he looked at them

305
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:36,100
Everybody could see them

306
00:27:37,850 --> 00:27:43,820
"But are they tubes of toothpaste?" he asked

307
00:27:44,150 --> 00:27:50,700
"No! men and women of the jury, they are not"

308
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:58,500
"Oh no, there is no toothpaste in these tubes"

309
00:27:59,350 --> 00:28:02,500
"There is heroin in them"

310
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:09,450
"Yes heroin, a bad dirty drug"

311
00:28:10,650 --> 00:28:13,800
"Perhaps the worst drug"

312
00:28:15,050 --> 00:28:18,250
"People die from this drug"

313
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:23,100
"The 'white death' they call it"

314
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:29,100
The lawyer stopped and looked at the jury

315
00:28:30,550 --> 00:28:33,400
He waited for a minute or two

316
00:28:35,050 --> 00:28:38,000
The courtroom was very quiet

317
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:42,350
Then he began again

318
00:28:43,350 --> 00:28:46,550
"But why, you ask me"

319
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:54,050
"Why did these two young people have this heroin in their bags?"

320
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,280
"I can't tell you"

321
00:28:57,710 --> 00:29:04,350
"Because heroin is one of the most expensive drugs, too"

322
00:29:06,150 --> 00:29:11,400
"They can sell these tubes of heroin in our country"

323
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:21,100
"For perhaps 80,000 pounds, 80,000 pounds! easy money!"

324
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:28,950
"And, men and women of the jury, many people in our country"

325
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:35,350
"Young people, schoolchildren, too take this drug"

326
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:41,400
"At first it's exciting, and they feel happy"

327
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:47,050
"But then they need more and more heroin"

328
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:52,150
"And they need more money to buy the drug"

329
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:56,700
"They leave their homes and families"

330
00:29:57,350 --> 00:30:04,050
"They take more heroin and more, they can't stop"

331
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:08,950
"Soon the drug begins to kill them"

332
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:13,250
"And in the end, they die"

333
00:30:14,450 --> 00:30:16,680
"The white death"

334
00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:23,600
"It's not a quick death, and it's not an easy death"

335
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:28,310
"Yes, men and women of the jury"

336
00:30:28,850 --> 00:30:32,600
"Many young people and children"

337
00:30:33,050 --> 00:30:42,300
"Your children and my children remember, die because of this drug"

338
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:50,000
"The Lawyer stopped again, the jury watched him and waited"

339
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:58,150
"He's very good" Anna thought "very very good"

340
00:30:59,150 --> 00:31:05,340
"He's telling the jury an exciting story, and they like him"

341
00:31:06,710 --> 00:31:09,300
"But it isn't good for Sarah"

342
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:17,550
The lawyer walked across the courtroom, and stood in front of the jury

343
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:23,600
"But my friends" he said to the jury

344
00:31:24,050 --> 00:31:32,650
"We have a law in this country, and the law is not difficult to understand"

345
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:40,600
"When people bring heroin into this country, they bring death too"

346
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:48,500
"We need to stop these people, and how can we do that?"

347
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:57,300
"The answer is easy, the law for these people is death"

348
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:02,650
The lawyer walked back to his table

349
00:32:04,150 --> 00:32:10,650
"Now, please look at these two young people here in this court"

350
00:32:11,250 --> 00:32:13,050
He said to the jury

351
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:17,100
"They brought heroin into this country"

352
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:22,200
"The airport police are going to tell you about it"

353
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:28,850
"Please listen carefully it's not a long story"

354
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:34,250
"And remember the law is death"

355
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:40,040
The police lawyer sat down

356
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:45,150
And an airport policeman went to the front of the courtroom

357
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:51,000
Anna felt ill. She looked at Sarah

358
00:32:51,850 --> 00:32:56,050
Sarah was white-faced and very afraid

359
00:32:57,050 --> 00:32:59,440
Anna closed her eyes

360
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:05,650
"Sarah" she thought "Oh Sarah"

361
00:33:07,550 --> 00:33:11,000
The police lawyer stood up again

362
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:17,560
"Please tell the court about Sarah Harland and Hassan"

363
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:20,900
He said to the airport policeman

364
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:25,250
"Yes sir" said the policeman

365
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:30,700
"I found two tubes of toothpaste in the girl's bag"

366
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:34,750
"And one tube in the young man's bag"

367
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:39,900
"All three tubes had heroin in them"

368
00:33:40,650 --> 00:33:46,000
"Thank you" the police lawyer sat down

369
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:52,350
And Mr Chen Sarah's and Hassan's lawyer stood up

370
00:33:54,400 --> 00:34:01,650
"What did Sarah Harland say, when you found the heroin?" he asked

371
00:34:02,350 --> 00:34:06,550
"Nothing sir, she began to cry"

372
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:11,950
"I see, was she afraid?"

373
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:16,250
The policeman thought for a minute

374
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:23,500
"I don't know sir, perhaps she was yes"

375
00:34:24,850 --> 00:34:29,700
"And she said nothing? are you sure?"

376
00:34:31,250 --> 00:34:33,850
The policeman thought again

377
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:40,650
"Well yes sir, I think perhaps she said..."

378
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:46,900
"This isn't my toothpaste, this is all wrong"

379
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:54,350
"I see, and what about the young man Hassan?"

380
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:57,200
"What did he say?"

381
00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:02,300
"Well sir, He was very angry"

382
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:11,500
"He said, it's not heroin, that's not true, you put it there"

383
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:15,700
"I see, thank you"

384
00:35:16,950 --> 00:35:24,400
"Now tell me why did you look in these two young people's bags?"

385
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:31,650
"You don't usually look in everyone's bags, there isn't time"

386
00:35:33,350 --> 00:35:40,150
The policeman thought again "Well, no sir, we don't"

387
00:35:40,650 --> 00:35:45,700
"I... I'm afraid I can't tell you sir"

388
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:52,250
"What did you say?" Mr Chen asked very angrily

389
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:58,400
"Of course you can tell me, this is a court of law"

390
00:35:59,550 --> 00:36:01,560
He looked at judge

391
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:09,150
This is a very important question, we need an answer

392
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:14,600
The judge looked at the airport policeman

393
00:36:14,950 --> 00:36:17,640
"I'm sorry" he said

394
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:24,600
"Please answer the question, the court needs to know the answer"

395
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:32,500
"Yes sir, well... you see, there was a telephone call"

396
00:36:33,550 --> 00:36:38,750
"Someone telephoned me before the plane arrived"

397
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:46,650
"The telephone caller said 'there's some heroin on the plane'"

398
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:52,250
"A young man and a young woman are carrying it"

399
00:36:53,150 --> 00:36:57,160
"I see" Mr Chen said.

400
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:02,950
He smiled "That's very interesting"

401
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:07,100
"And who made this telephone call?"

402
00:37:08,450 --> 00:37:12,450
"I don't know" the policeman said

403
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:21,600
"It was a man, and he talked in English. I don't know his name"

404
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:27,880
Suddenly Anna heard a noise.

405
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:34,060
She looked behind her at the door of the courtroom

406
00:37:35,730 --> 00:37:41,160
A tall young man came into the back of the room

407
00:37:41,930 --> 00:37:50,600
Anna knew him at once, it was Stephen, Sarah's old boyfriend

408
00:37:51,860 --> 00:37:56,660
A policeman took him to a chair near Anna

409
00:37:58,260 --> 00:38:03,880
He saw Anna and for a second he looked afraid

410
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:10,200
But then he smiled and sat down next to her

411
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:16,720
"Mrs Harland" he said quietly

412
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:21,880
"It's good to see you, when did you arrived?"

413
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:28,330
"Yesterday" she said "Why are you late?"

414
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:34,240
"I couldn't find the court" he answered.

415
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:37,800
He looked very unhappy

416
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:42,240
"Tell me how to help?" he said

417
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:48,860
"I want to help Sarah, but what can I do?"

418
00:38:49,530 --> 00:38:55,360
"I was on the plane too, but I couldn't help her"

419
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:59,860
"I don't want her to die"

420
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:06,880
"Stay with me, young man" Anna said quietly

421
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:12,600
"We can help her, I'm sure we can"

422
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:22,460
Later that morning, Sarah went to the front of the courtroom

423
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:29,460
Her face was very white, and her eyes were red with crying

424
00:39:30,530 --> 00:39:36,080
Her lawyer Mr Chen began to ask her questions

425
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:42,440
"Now Miss Harland why did you come to this country?"

426
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:47,530
He asked quietly and smiled at her

427
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:55,930
"Because I like going to different countries, I want to meet new people"

428
00:39:57,260 --> 00:40:01,260
"And why were you with this young man?"

429
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:08,460
"Because..." Sarah stopped and looked down at her feet

430
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:11,760
Nobody could see her face

431
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:19,860
She began again very quietly, but nobody could hear her

432
00:40:20,530 --> 00:40:28,260
"I'm sorry we can't hear you, can you say that again please?"

433
00:40:29,730 --> 00:40:31,760
Sarah looked up

434
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:37,000
She looked quickly at her mother, And then at Hassan

435
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:40,820
"Because I love him"

436
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:46,060
Anna felt old and tired

437
00:40:47,060 --> 00:40:52,730
She looked at the tall young man with the beautiful dark eyes

438
00:40:53,460 --> 00:41:00,130
"It was his heroin" she thought "I'm sure It was"

439
00:41:00,730 --> 00:41:07,720
"He buys and sells heroin and he put it in my daughter's bag"

440
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:11,730
"And now she says she loves him"

441
00:41:13,330 --> 00:41:15,720
Stephen sat next to her

442
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:21,860
He did not move, and he watched Sarah all the time

443
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:25,460
But she did not look at him

444
00:41:27,130 --> 00:41:33,860
Mr Chen waited a minute, and then he questioned Sarah again

445
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:42,040
"Did you know about the heroin in those tubes of toothpaste?" he asked

446
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:48,860
"No" Sarah said quickly "Of course I didn't"

447
00:41:49,930 --> 00:41:56,000
"And what about Hassan? did he know about the heroin?"

448
00:41:56,640 --> 00:42:00,400
"Please think about your answer"

449
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:08,200
"No I'm sure he didn't know, it wasn't our heroin"

450
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:12,530
Sarah's blue eyes were angry

451
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:20,660
"We didn't put the heroin in the toothpaste tubes, we are innocent"

452
00:42:21,130 --> 00:42:28,800
"Thank you Miss Harland" Mr Chen said quietly and sat down

453
00:42:29,930 --> 00:42:32,560
The police lawyer stood up

454
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:39,930
"Miss Harland, how much money did you have in your bag?"

455
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:45,130
"Um... about... 50 pounds I think"

456
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:52,130
"That's not very much, this is an expensive country you know"

457
00:42:52,730 --> 00:42:58,330
"How much can you buy? with your 50 pounds"

458
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:03,000
Sarah did not have an answer

459
00:43:03,930 --> 00:43:09,400
"Um... I don't know" she began

460
00:43:10,060 --> 00:43:13,660
"I usually live very cheaply"

461
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:17,240
"Did you need more money?"

462
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:21,530
The Lawyer's questions came quickly now

463
00:43:21,530 --> 00:43:28,730
"Of course you needed more money, you wanted to sell that heroin"

464
00:43:28,730 --> 00:43:33,200
"You wanted to be rich, is that right?"

465
00:43:33,860 --> 00:43:37,660
"No no, that's not true"

466
00:43:39,060 --> 00:43:42,000
The lawyer said nothing for a minute

467
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:46,400
He looked at the jury and smiled

468
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:48,760
Then he said

469
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:56,660
"Do you think toothpaste is very expensive in this country, Miss Harland?"

470
00:43:57,650 --> 00:44:03,570
"Oh no, I don't think. oh I don't know"

471
00:44:04,970 --> 00:44:07,900
"Well, I can tell you. it isn't"

472
00:44:08,750 --> 00:44:11,320
"Toothpaste is cheap here"

473
00:44:12,470 --> 00:44:17,920
"So why did you bring three tubes of toothpaste with you?"

474
00:44:19,550 --> 00:44:23,000
"How often do you clean your teeth, Miss Harland?"

475
00:44:23,750 --> 00:44:29,120
"Six times a day? Or seven? Or eight times a day, perhaps..."

476
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:32,350
Sarah looked very unhappy

477
00:44:33,050 --> 00:44:37,320
"No I don't know, Hassan..."

478
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:41,570
"Yes" the lawyer said quickly "Hassan"

479
00:44:42,350 --> 00:44:46,520
"Are you going to say 'Hassan gave it to me'?"

480
00:44:48,050 --> 00:44:52,600
"You love this young man, but you don't want to die"

481
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:55,420
"Nobody wants to die"

482
00:44:56,550 --> 00:45:01,800
"And now you are going to say 'It was Hassan's toothpaste'"

483
00:45:02,620 --> 00:45:05,200
"Is that your answer, Miss Harland?"

484
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:11,250
"No" Sarah said angrily "Of course not"

485
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:14,850
"It was my toothpaste, but..."

486
00:45:15,100 --> 00:45:17,350
"Thank you, Miss Harland"

487
00:45:18,470 --> 00:45:24,300
The police lawyer sat down "I have no more questions"

488
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:39,640
-

489
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:41,200
Chapter 4

490
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:47,950
At 1 o'clock, the judge left the court for an hour

491
00:45:49,570 --> 00:45:53,400
Anna Harland talked to Sarah for ten minutes

492
00:45:54,570 --> 00:45:56,750
Sarah cried at first

493
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:02,050
"I don't like that police lawyer" she said

494
00:46:02,870 --> 00:46:08,120
"Those questions were very difficult, I couldn't answer them"

495
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:12,900
"It doesn't matter" her mother said

496
00:46:13,620 --> 00:46:17,520
"Your lawyer Mr Chen is very good"

497
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:21,470
"And Stephen is here too, now"

498
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:24,300
"We are all going to help you"

499
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,650
Sarah was angry

500
00:46:28,850 --> 00:46:32,750
"Don't talk to me about Stephen" she said

501
00:46:33,450 --> 00:46:34,970
"I don't like him"

502
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:38,400
"I don't want to see him here"

503
00:46:40,620 --> 00:46:45,750
"But Sarah he was your boyfriend for two years"

504
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:48,570
"He wants to help you"

505
00:46:50,650 --> 00:46:53,070
Sarah began to cry again

506
00:46:54,070 --> 00:46:58,900
"Perhaps he does want to help me, I don't know"

507
00:46:59,850 --> 00:47:02,370
"But he's different now, mother"

508
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:05,120
"You don't understand"

509
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:11,970
"His eyes are different, they are... I don't know"

510
00:47:13,070 --> 00:47:17,650
"And he can't sit quietly and talk to people now"

511
00:47:18,620 --> 00:47:21,750
"His body is moving all the time"

512
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:27,250
"He came to see me in our hotel"

513
00:47:27,700 --> 00:47:31,270
"The night before we came to this country, and..."

514
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:34,300
"I didn't like him mother"

515
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:37,050
"Why is he here?"

516
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:43,150
"He doesn't love me now, And I don't love him"

517
00:47:45,870 --> 00:47:48,650
Anna listened carefully to her daughter

518
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:54,770
And then she went to see Mr Chen and Inspector Aziz

519
00:47:55,620 --> 00:47:57,500
Stephen went with her

520
00:48:00,020 --> 00:48:05,300
"Who made that phone call to the police, at the airport?" she asked

521
00:48:06,070 --> 00:48:07,970
"We need to know that"

522
00:48:09,550 --> 00:48:14,800
"Yes" Mr Chen said "That's very important"

523
00:48:15,570 --> 00:48:17,470
"Can the police tell us?"

524
00:48:18,950 --> 00:48:22,350
"Perhaps" the Inspector said

525
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:29,400
"But it's very difficult, It was not a long telephone call"

526
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:33,370
"And the man didn't give his name"

527
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:39,400
"Perhaps he was a policeman, and he knew about the heroin"

528
00:48:41,020 --> 00:48:44,320
"Perhaps" Mr Chen said

529
00:48:45,020 --> 00:48:49,720
"But then, perhaps he put the heroin there"

530
00:48:50,670 --> 00:48:53,670
"And he wanted the police to find it"

531
00:48:54,550 --> 00:48:59,720
"Perhaps someone doesn't like your daughter, Mrs Harland"

532
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:08,570
"I don't know" Anna said slowly "But perhaps..."

533
00:49:09,770 --> 00:49:13,670
But then the judge came back into the courtroom

534
00:49:14,100 --> 00:49:16,420
And everybody stopped talking

535
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:21,570
The judge then called Hassan

536
00:49:22,950 --> 00:49:27,370
Hassan stood up and went to the front of the courtroom

537
00:49:29,070 --> 00:49:32,200
"He's a rich boy" Anna thought

538
00:49:32,950 --> 00:49:37,950
"That shirt and those shoes are very expensive"

539
00:49:40,620 --> 00:49:44,900
Hassan stood there, tall and very quiet

540
00:49:45,970 --> 00:49:48,150
He waited for the questions

541
00:49:49,700 --> 00:49:51,720
He did not look afraid

542
00:49:53,020 --> 00:49:56,300
But when Mr Chen looked at his papers

543
00:49:56,300 --> 00:49:58,670
And asked the first question

544
00:49:59,070 --> 00:50:01,550
Hassan closed his eyes

545
00:50:03,950 --> 00:50:08,170
"Did you know about the heroin in those tubes of toothpaste?"

546
00:50:09,350 --> 00:50:10,250
"No sir"

547
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:12,900
"Did Sarah know?"

548
00:50:13,620 --> 00:50:14,370
"No sir"

549
00:50:15,950 --> 00:50:18,050
"Who bought the toothpaste"

550
00:50:19,350 --> 00:50:24,070
Hassan closed his eyes again for two or three seconds

551
00:50:24,950 --> 00:50:28,620
Then he answered "I did sir"

552
00:50:29,670 --> 00:50:33,220
"You did, You're sure of that?"

553
00:50:34,550 --> 00:50:36,800
"Yes sir, I'm sure"

554
00:50:37,220 --> 00:50:39,900
"I clean my teeth a lot, you see"

555
00:50:41,020 --> 00:50:43,670
Hassan smiled for a moment

556
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:50,700
"Well, he does have very white teeth" Anna thought

557
00:50:52,750 --> 00:50:57,720
"Sarah"  Hassan began, then he stopped

558
00:50:58,040 --> 00:50:58,950
"Yes?"

559
00:51:00,670 --> 00:51:06,150
Again Hassan closed his eyes and waited for a second

560
00:51:08,020 --> 00:51:12,850
Then he looked at the jury and said very loudly:

561
00:51:14,070 --> 00:51:18,250
"Sarah did not buy the toothpaste, I bought it"

562
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:21,950
"I bought all three tubes of toothpaste"

563
00:51:22,770 --> 00:51:25,170
"It was my toothpaste"

564
00:51:27,470 --> 00:51:32,850
Anna sat up in her chair, And looked carefully at Hassan

565
00:51:34,570 --> 00:51:41,450
"That's interesting" she thought "Perhaps he does love Sarah"

566
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:46,020
"I see" Mr Chen said

567
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:50,770
"And when did you first meet Sarah Harland?"

568
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:56,950
"About two months ago, I was in Australia"

569
00:51:57,900 --> 00:52:00,220
"We were in the same hotel"

570
00:52:01,450 --> 00:52:06,520
"She had... a difficult time with her boyfriend"

571
00:52:07,050 --> 00:52:08,750
"And I helped her"

572
00:52:10,550 --> 00:52:15,170
Anna looked at Stephen, he was very angry

573
00:52:15,950 --> 00:52:19,970
And he hit the chair in front of him with his hand

574
00:52:21,270 --> 00:52:25,070
"I see" Mr Chen said again

575
00:52:26,550 --> 00:52:29,000
Then he asked his next question

576
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:34,170
"Do you usually carry a lot of money?"

577
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:39,220
"How much money did you have at the airport?"

578
00:52:40,570 --> 00:52:43,150
"About 80 pounds I think"

579
00:52:44,100 --> 00:52:45,020
"That's OK"

580
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:49,920
"When I need more money I get some work for a week or two"

581
00:52:51,100 --> 00:52:53,120
"We don't need much money"

582
00:52:55,450 --> 00:52:58,670
"And do you sometimes take heroin?"

583
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:01,200
"No sir, never"

584
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:06,450
"Thank you, stay there please"

585
00:53:08,620 --> 00:53:10,700
Mr Chen sat down

586
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:13,550
And the police lawyer stood up

587
00:53:14,670 --> 00:53:19,870
He smiled at Hassan, But it was not a nice smile

588
00:53:21,550 --> 00:53:26,370
"Now Hassan, You bought the toothpaste"

589
00:53:26,570 --> 00:53:31,050
"But it was in Miss Harland's bag, why?"

590
00:53:32,370 --> 00:53:34,950
"Why did she carry it for you"

591
00:53:35,620 --> 00:53:40,600
"Or do you always ask your women to carry things for you?"

592
00:53:41,450 --> 00:53:45,920
He smiled, Hassan said nothing

593
00:53:48,050 --> 00:53:49,920
The lawyer began again

594
00:53:51,270 --> 00:53:54,520
"You had 80 pounds you say"

595
00:53:55,270 --> 00:54:01,520
"But 80,000 pounds... is better than 80 pounds, I think"

596
00:54:02,650 --> 00:54:04,470
"What do you think?"

597
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:11,450
"Of course It is, but I don't sell heroin"

598
00:54:12,350 --> 00:54:14,750
"It's wrong to sell heroin"

599
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:20,170
The lawyer moved his papers on the table

600
00:54:21,220 --> 00:54:22,970
He looked at the jury

601
00:54:24,050 --> 00:54:28,550
"So, you are a very good young man"

602
00:54:28,550 --> 00:54:32,520
"With very clean teeth but no money"

603
00:54:33,800 --> 00:54:36,550
"You met a young English girl"

604
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:40,620
"She was unhappy with her boyfriend"

605
00:54:40,950 --> 00:54:45,350
"So you helped her and took her away with you"

606
00:54:46,220 --> 00:54:47,340
"Is that right?"

607
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:53,870
"Oh dear! It's not a very good story, you know"

608
00:54:55,100 --> 00:54:56,970
"I don't believe it"

609
00:54:57,270 --> 00:55:01,770
"And I don't think the jury believes it, young man"

610
00:55:04,020 --> 00:55:05,720
He stopped for a minute

611
00:55:06,900 --> 00:55:10,470
Then he looked at Hassan and said loudly:

612
00:55:11,300 --> 00:55:17,300
"You don't love Sarah Harland, And she doesn't love you"

613
00:55:18,450 --> 00:55:22,550
"You went with her because, she could help you"

614
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:28,720
"And she went with you because she wanted the money"

615
00:55:30,270 --> 00:55:34,050
"She carry the heroin for you to sell"

616
00:55:35,170 --> 00:55:36,920
"That's right isn't it?"

617
00:55:37,750 --> 00:55:41,350
"You put the heroin in the toothpaste tubes"

618
00:55:41,670 --> 00:55:43,920
"And she knew about it"

619
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:50,850
"Is that the true story, young man? I think it is"

620
00:55:51,970 --> 00:55:55,620
"No I..." Hassan began angrily

621
00:55:56,420 --> 00:55:58,370
But the lawyer did not listen

622
00:55:59,070 --> 00:56:00,250
He sat down

623
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:05,700
"I have no more questions" he said to the judge

624
00:56:06,050 --> 00:56:20,525
-

625
00:56:20,670 --> 00:56:22,120
Chapter 5

626
00:56:24,450 --> 00:56:29,470
The judge looked at his papers, and then at the jury

627
00:56:30,770 --> 00:56:36,000
"It is now 4 o'clock in the afternoon" he said

628
00:56:36,900 --> 00:56:39,520
"We can begin again in the morning"

629
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:43,670
"Please be here at 10 o'clock"

630
00:56:45,950 --> 00:56:49,520
The judge stood up and left the courtroom

631
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:52,850
The jury left too

632
00:56:54,170 --> 00:56:59,020
And the police took Sarah and Hassan back to the prison

633
00:57:01,070 --> 00:57:03,250
Anna looked at Stephen

634
00:57:05,050 --> 00:57:10,250
"Well young man" she said "What can we do now?"

635
00:57:11,450 --> 00:57:15,350
"We have 16 hours, before tomorrow morning"

636
00:57:17,570 --> 00:57:20,900
"I don't know" Stephen said

637
00:57:22,100 --> 00:57:23,870
He looked at her for a minute

638
00:57:24,450 --> 00:57:29,450
Then he looked away over her head at the front of the court

639
00:57:31,250 --> 00:57:36,170
"I'm sure, Hassan knew about the heroin" he said

640
00:57:37,370 --> 00:57:41,470
"He put it in her bag, I'm sure he did"

641
00:57:42,820 --> 00:57:47,000
"Sarah is innocent, but he isn't"

642
00:57:49,300 --> 00:57:52,050
Mr Chen came and stood with them

643
00:57:52,900 --> 00:57:59,320
"She's innocent" Stephen said again "But Hassan's going to die"

644
00:58:01,020 --> 00:58:04,000
Mr Chen looked at Stephen carefully

645
00:58:05,270 --> 00:58:08,400
"Perhaps" he said slowly

646
00:58:09,170 --> 00:58:12,320
"But did you listen to Hassan in court?"

647
00:58:13,150 --> 00:58:20,800
"He said 'Sarah did not buy the toothpaste, It was my toothpaste'"

648
00:58:22,750 --> 00:58:24,900
"Now why did he say that?"

649
00:58:26,550 --> 00:58:29,820
"It was not an easy thing to say, you know?"

650
00:58:31,270 --> 00:58:34,450
"What is the jury going to think about it?"

651
00:58:37,270 --> 00:58:41,050
"It doesn't matter" Stephen said angrily

652
00:58:42,050 --> 00:58:47,870
"Because it wasn't toothpaste, And he didn't buy it in a shop"

653
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:54,400
"He made those tubes, Because he wanted to sell the heroin"

654
00:58:55,470 --> 00:58:57,870
"And he's going to die"

655
00:58:58,750 --> 00:59:01,050
"That's the law in this country"

656
00:59:03,350 --> 00:59:06,700
Anna looked at Stephen and said nothing

657
00:59:07,900 --> 00:59:11,020
"He's very angry" she thought

658
00:59:11,950 --> 00:59:16,500
"His face is red, and he's talking very quickly"

659
00:59:18,050 --> 00:59:20,250
"Does he want to kill Hassan?'

660
00:59:21,700 --> 00:59:24,450
"And what's the matter with his eyes?"

661
00:59:25,570 --> 00:59:28,520
Mr Chen watched Stephen too

662
00:59:29,750 --> 00:59:32,770
"But who made that telephone call?"

663
00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:38,270
"It's important and I want to know" he said

664
00:59:39,700 --> 00:59:42,550
"I'm going to ask the police now"

665
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:47,100
"Would you like to come with me, Mrs Harland?"

666
00:59:48,300 --> 00:59:51,650
"Yes, Of course" Anna said

667
00:59:52,250 --> 00:59:54,600
"Stephen are you coming?"

668
00:59:55,620 --> 01:00:00,870
"Yes, ah... no no" Stephen said

669
01:00:01,700 --> 01:00:06,720
"I'm going to meet a man, I think he can help us"

670
01:00:08,320 --> 01:00:10,750
"Alright" Anna said

671
01:00:12,070 --> 01:00:13,900
"But when can I meet you?"

672
01:00:14,770 --> 01:00:18,050
"I need to talk to you about Hassan"

673
01:00:18,850 --> 01:00:21,400
"Can I come to your hotel tonight?"

674
01:00:22,520 --> 01:00:28,100
"Ah... no, not tonight" Stephen said quickly

675
01:00:29,320 --> 01:00:34,270
His face was now white, And he looked tired and ill

676
01:00:35,120 --> 01:00:38,750
His hands and body moved all the time

677
01:00:40,250 --> 01:00:43,950
"Come to my hotel tomorrow morning, bye"

678
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:48,100
He walked quickly out of the courtroom

679
01:00:49,320 --> 01:00:52,170
Anna and Mr Chen watched him

680
01:00:53,720 --> 01:00:56,750
Inspector Aziz was near the door

681
01:00:57,200 --> 01:01:00,070
And he watched Stephen too

682
01:01:01,460 --> 01:01:14,740
-

683
01:01:14,920 --> 01:01:16,550
Chapter 6

684
01:01:18,100 --> 01:01:22,200
Anna and Mr Chen talked to the police

685
01:01:23,120 --> 01:01:29,350
But the police could tell them nothing more about the telephone call to the airport

686
01:01:31,320 --> 01:01:35,600
Inspector Aziz telephoned two or three people

687
01:01:36,650 --> 01:01:39,550
And then, he talked to Anna again

688
01:01:41,470 --> 01:01:46,470
When Anna left Inspector Aziz, she was much happier

689
01:01:49,300 --> 01:01:52,720
Then she went to the prison to see Sarah

690
01:01:54,450 --> 01:01:57,170
The man took her to Sarah's room

691
01:01:58,600 --> 01:02:01,700
Anna and Sarah sat at the table

692
01:02:02,300 --> 01:02:05,000
And the man stood and watched

693
01:02:07,320 --> 01:02:13,920
"It was a bad day mother, I'm sorry" Sarah said slowly

694
01:02:15,370 --> 01:02:20,800
Her eyes were not red now, But she looked very tired

695
01:02:22,750 --> 01:02:26,320
Her hands were near her mother's on the table

696
01:02:28,720 --> 01:02:34,150
"It wasn't a very good day, that's true" Anna said

697
01:02:35,250 --> 01:02:38,720
"But you have a very good lawyer you know"

698
01:02:39,570 --> 01:02:41,400
"The Jury likes him"

699
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:46,850
"But it doesn't help" Sarah said

700
01:02:48,920 --> 01:02:52,850
"There was heroin in the toothpaste tubes"

701
01:02:53,420 --> 01:02:56,800
"And the tubes were in my bag"

702
01:02:58,070 --> 01:03:00,300
"What can Mr Chen do?"

703
01:03:01,570 --> 01:03:04,970
"The heroin was in my bag mother"

704
01:03:06,100 --> 01:03:08,170
"The jury knows that"

705
01:03:10,550 --> 01:03:13,300
Anna looked at her daughter carefully

706
01:03:15,320 --> 01:03:20,370
"Perhaps Hassan put it there Sarah" she said

707
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:26,470
"You like him I know, And he looks nice, but..."

708
01:03:26,950 --> 01:03:33,970
"Mother I love him, I said that in court, you heard me"

709
01:03:35,100 --> 01:03:38,050
"And Hassan loves me too"

710
01:03:39,050 --> 01:03:44,330
"And he does not buy or sell heroin. I..."

711
01:03:45,040 --> 01:03:49,670
Sarah stopped talking, And put her hands on her stomach

712
01:03:50,450 --> 01:03:53,300
"What's the matter?" Anna asked

713
01:03:54,320 --> 01:03:55,920
She looked at the man

714
01:03:56,700 --> 01:04:00,370
"Quickly she's ill get a doctor"

715
01:04:01,970 --> 01:04:04,200
The man ran from the room

716
01:04:04,600 --> 01:04:07,600
And Anna put her arms round her daughter

717
01:04:08,900 --> 01:04:12,750
She waited, and then Sarah sat up

718
01:04:14,170 --> 01:04:17,100
"It's alright, mother" she said

719
01:04:18,120 --> 01:04:22,500
Her face was very white, but she looked a little better

720
01:04:23,220 --> 01:04:28,050
"It happens sometimes, I often feel ill"

721
01:04:28,600 --> 01:04:34,470
"And I don't like to eat much, But it's not very bad"

722
01:04:35,520 --> 01:04:39,670
"I think I'm going to stay alive, because of it"

723
01:04:40,820 --> 01:04:42,950
She gave her mother a smile

724
01:04:44,300 --> 01:04:47,420
"What? What are you saying?"

725
01:04:48,320 --> 01:04:52,370
"What are you talking about?" Anna cried

726
01:04:54,100 --> 01:04:55,400
"My baby"

727
01:04:57,100 --> 01:04:59,500
Sarah's face looked different now

728
01:05:00,250 --> 01:05:03,120
Half smiling half afraid

729
01:05:04,270 --> 01:05:07,170
"Mother, don't be angry please"

730
01:05:08,100 --> 01:05:12,970
"I'm going to have a baby, It's Hassan's baby"

731
01:05:13,150 --> 01:05:17,200
"I.. We wanted to come to England"

732
01:05:17,370 --> 01:05:21,900
"And tell you about it there, but now we can't"

733
01:05:22,900 --> 01:05:27,620
"I love him, and he wants to be my husband, mother"

734
01:05:28,950 --> 01:05:32,700
"Mother please don't be angry"

735
01:05:34,770 --> 01:05:37,200
Anna's face was white now

736
01:05:38,650 --> 01:05:42,020
For nearly a minute, she could say nothing

737
01:05:43,350 --> 01:05:46,720
She wanted to cry, but she didn't

738
01:05:49,120 --> 01:05:53,520
At last she said "Oh Sarah"

739
01:05:54,250 --> 01:05:57,320
"What's going to happen to this baby?"

740
01:05:59,350 --> 01:06:03,850
Sarah looked at her hands "Nothing, mother"

741
01:06:05,050 --> 01:06:07,570
"I asked Mr Chen about that"

742
01:06:09,100 --> 01:06:11,400
"They can't kill me, you see"

743
01:06:11,850 --> 01:06:14,370
"Because I'm going to have a baby"

744
01:06:15,870 --> 01:06:19,250
"They can't kill a mother and her baby"

745
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:23,370
"That's the law, but..."

746
01:06:24,300 --> 01:06:26,720
"That doesn't help Hassan"

747
01:06:27,870 --> 01:06:31,320
Anna heard a noise and looked at the door

748
01:06:32,450 --> 01:06:37,720
"Listen Sarah" she said quickly "Before the doctor comes..."

749
01:06:38,720 --> 01:06:44,150
"I'm not angry, and I do love you Sarah, Of course"

750
01:06:44,820 --> 01:06:50,150
"But listen, I talked to Inspector Aziz, again today"

751
01:06:51,220 --> 01:06:55,550
"I think he can help you and Hassan too"

752
01:06:56,750 --> 01:07:02,600
"So don't be afraid, Please and..." the door opened

753
01:07:02,850 --> 01:07:05,620
And the man came in with a woman doctor

754
01:07:06,950 --> 01:07:11,120
Anna stood up, she took Sarah's hand

755
01:07:12,950 --> 01:07:17,100
"I'm going now Sarah, but don't be afraid"

756
01:07:17,770 --> 01:07:22,000
"You are going to be alright, I'm sure of it"

757
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:37,130

758
01:07:37,550 --> 01:07:38,600
Chapter 7

759
01:07:40,820 --> 01:07:43,900
Next morning, at half past four

760
01:07:44,350 --> 01:07:49,270
Anna Harland stood in a quiet road in front of a hotel

761
01:07:50,700 --> 01:07:56,400
She waited, and then she heard a car behind the hotel

762
01:07:58,050 --> 01:08:01,070
The car doors opened and closed

763
01:08:02,970 --> 01:08:07,650
She waited quietly and then looked down the road

764
01:08:09,120 --> 01:08:13,870
A man walked into the road, and stood next to a shop

765
01:08:15,300 --> 01:08:21,400
He did not look at Anna, but Anna looked at him, and smiled

766
01:08:22,650 --> 01:08:25,670
Then she walked into the hotel

767
01:08:27,800 --> 01:08:31,900
She went upstairs, and knocked on the door of a bedroom

768
01:08:32,770 --> 01:08:34,250
A man answered

769
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:36,420
"Who is it?"

770
01:08:37,700 --> 01:08:40,570
"It's me, Stephen" she said

771
01:08:40,770 --> 01:08:46,000
"Anna Harland. Open the door please, I want to talk to you"

772
01:08:47,720 --> 01:08:52,250
The door opened, and Stephen looked out slowly

773
01:08:53,520 --> 01:08:54,370
"Anna?"

774
01:08:55,700 --> 01:08:59,120
"What are you doing here, at this time? It's..."

775
01:08:59,480 --> 01:09:02,170
Anna walked quickly into the room

776
01:09:02,600 --> 01:09:05,100
"Yes, It's half past four"

777
01:09:05,850 --> 01:09:08,950
"Sarah is in court again, at 10 o'clock"

778
01:09:09,870 --> 01:09:14,150
"I need your help young man, Please get up"

779
01:09:14,920 --> 01:09:17,500
"But what can I do?"

780
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:20,350
Anna looked at him

781
01:09:22,170 --> 01:09:26,670
"You went to see a man last night, What happened?"

782
01:09:27,820 --> 01:09:29,650
"Can he help Sarah?"

783
01:09:31,320 --> 01:09:36,000
Stephen answered slowly, he did not looked at Anna

784
01:09:37,220 --> 01:09:41,320
"No, I'm sorry, he can't"

785
01:09:42,920 --> 01:09:47,970
Anna was cold and angry, "I see" she said

786
01:09:48,870 --> 01:09:52,170
"Well, can you and I help her then?"

787
01:09:53,220 --> 01:09:57,900
"Tell me Stephen, what do you know about Hassan?"

788
01:09:59,250 --> 01:10:02,600
"Hassan?" Stephen said angrily

789
01:10:03,550 --> 01:10:09,770
"Well, we met him in Australia and Sarah, went away with him"

790
01:10:10,770 --> 01:10:14,650
"She doesn't understand him, but I do"

791
01:10:15,570 --> 01:10:19,300
"He's a rich young man with a beautiful body"

792
01:10:20,150 --> 01:10:25,320
"He likes playing with girls, But he doesn't love her"

793
01:10:27,320 --> 01:10:30,050
"And do you love her, Stephen?"

794
01:10:32,220 --> 01:10:34,700
Stephen did not answer at once

795
01:10:35,770 --> 01:10:38,770
For two or three seconds Anna waited

796
01:10:40,400 --> 01:10:46,350
"He doesn't know" she thought "He can't answer the question"

797
01:10:47,820 --> 01:10:51,520
"Yes Mrs Harland, Of course I love her"

798
01:10:53,150 --> 01:10:56,700
"But he's not looking at me" Anna thought

799
01:10:57,650 --> 01:10:59,800
"He's looking out of the window"

800
01:11:00,900 --> 01:11:03,400
"He's not thinking about Sarah"

801
01:11:04,970 --> 01:11:08,470
"Stephen" Anna asked quietly

802
01:11:09,220 --> 01:11:16,470
"Did you go to see Sarah and Hassan in Australia, The night before they came to this country?"

803
01:11:18,120 --> 01:11:19,700
Stephen looked up at her

804
01:11:20,770 --> 01:11:26,200
"Ah... yes, I went to their hotel" he said

805
01:11:26,820 --> 01:11:31,320
"I asked Sarah to leave Hassan, and come back to me"

806
01:11:32,350 --> 01:11:34,400
"But how did you know that?"

807
01:11:36,300 --> 01:11:41,150
"Sarah told me of course. Was Hassan there?"

808
01:11:42,300 --> 01:11:45,570
"No he..." Stephen stopped

809
01:11:46,120 --> 01:11:49,370
Then he said "why do you ask?"

810
01:11:51,170 --> 01:11:53,350
Anna opened her handbag

811
01:11:54,420 --> 01:11:56,950
"Look at this" she said

812
01:11:57,800 --> 01:12:00,450
"What is it? Do you know?"

813
01:12:02,150 --> 01:12:04,800
He looked at it, and then at Anna

814
01:12:06,150 --> 01:12:08,970
"A tube of toothpaste, why?"

815
01:12:10,620 --> 01:12:14,470
"That's right, a policeman gave it to me"

816
01:12:15,170 --> 01:12:17,370
"And he took it from a man"

817
01:12:18,550 --> 01:12:21,970
"You met that man, last night Stephen"

818
01:12:23,050 --> 01:12:26,470
"You gave him ten tubes of toothpaste"

819
01:12:27,870 --> 01:12:31,920
"What was in those tubes of toothpaste Stephen?"

820
01:12:33,770 --> 01:12:35,470
Stephen said nothing

821
01:12:36,670 --> 01:12:39,500
He looked at the toothpaste and stood up

822
01:12:40,470 --> 01:12:43,400
But Anna was between him and the door

823
01:12:44,400 --> 01:12:46,500
She gave the toothpaste to him

824
01:12:47,920 --> 01:12:51,000
"Would you like to clean your teeth, Stephen?"

825
01:12:52,120 --> 01:12:57,000
He began to move to the door, but Anna took his arm

826
01:12:58,370 --> 01:13:01,850
"You don't love Sarah. Do you Stephen?"

827
01:13:02,450 --> 01:13:05,750
"You hate her, because she left you"

828
01:13:06,670 --> 01:13:11,000
"You put three of these tubes in Sarah's bag"

829
01:13:11,250 --> 01:13:13,900
"And then you phoned the police"

830
01:13:14,700 --> 01:13:19,000
"You told them about the tubes in my daughter's bag"

831
01:13:19,420 --> 01:13:22,050
"You want Sarah to die"

832
01:13:22,720 --> 01:13:28,750
"No" Stephen said "No no, not Sarah. Hassan!"

833
01:13:29,250 --> 01:13:33,320
"I put them in Hassan's bag, not Sarah's"

834
01:13:33,970 --> 01:13:36,550
"I wanted Hassan to die"

835
01:13:37,850 --> 01:13:41,470
He opened the door quickly, and then stopped

836
01:13:42,320 --> 01:13:46,900
A man stood there, Inspector Aziz

837
01:13:48,350 --> 01:13:50,870
He put his hand on Stephen's arm

838
01:13:52,400 --> 01:13:58,970
"It's an old story young man" he said "It happens everyday"

839
01:13:59,800 --> 01:14:03,420
"My first girlfriend left me for a new man"

840
01:14:04,020 --> 01:14:08,570
"I was very angry too, I hated him"

841
01:14:09,650 --> 01:14:12,050
"But I didn't want to kill him"

842
01:14:14,070 --> 01:14:16,320
"Come on let's go"

843
01:14:17,400 --> 01:14:20,720
"You can tell your story to the judge"

844
01:14:21,060 --> 01:14:35,660
-

845

Chapter 8

846
01:14:38,450 --> 01:14:40,800
At 11 o'clock that morning

847
01:14:41,300 --> 01:14:44,200
Sarah and Hassan were free

848
01:14:46,070 --> 01:14:51,670
Sarah stood with her mother, Inspector Aziz, and Mr Chen

849
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:54,500
She smiled happily

850
01:14:56,300 --> 01:14:58,350
"Mother you are wonderful"

851
01:14:59,350 --> 01:15:01,420
"Now, I can be happy"

852
01:15:02,850 --> 01:15:06,770
"But how did you know about Stephen?"

853
01:15:08,720 --> 01:15:11,200
Inspector Aziz answered:

854
01:15:12,370 --> 01:15:18,650
"Young woman" he said "Remember, your mother is a doctor"

855
01:15:20,050 --> 01:15:25,950
"She knew Stephen was ill, Because of his eyes and his body"

856
01:15:27,550 --> 01:15:34,270
"His eyes are very big and dark, And his body is always moving"

857
01:15:35,950 --> 01:15:41,970
"Well, yes" Anna said "But you helped me, Sarah"

858
01:15:43,420 --> 01:15:46,620
"You said he was different, remember?"

859
01:15:48,070 --> 01:15:52,370
"And I looked at him carefully, and began to think"

860
01:15:53,820 --> 01:15:56,100
"Heroin does that to people"

861
01:15:58,800 --> 01:16:03,420
"He did a very bad thing" Sarah said slowly

862
01:16:04,520 --> 01:16:07,200
"But I feel sorry for him now"

863
01:16:08,850 --> 01:16:11,720
"When is he going to court, Inspector?"

864
01:16:13,250 --> 01:16:19,320
"I don't know" the Inspector said "In two weeks perhaps"

865
01:16:20,570 --> 01:16:22,350
"But don't think about him"

866
01:16:23,320 --> 01:16:27,570
"Would you like to see our beautiful country, Mrs Harland?"

867
01:16:28,450 --> 01:16:30,220
"Where would you like to go?"

868
01:16:31,870 --> 01:16:33,700
Anna smiled at him

869
01:16:34,820 --> 01:16:37,570
"Thank you, but I can't stay"

870
01:16:38,400 --> 01:16:41,450
"Tomorrow, I'm going back to England"

871
01:16:41,770 --> 01:16:44,620
"To talk to Stephen's mother and father"

872
01:16:46,750 --> 01:16:51,720
Inspector Aziz looked at her, and said nothing for a minute

873
01:16:53,350 --> 01:16:55,170
Then he said quietly

874
01:16:56,370 --> 01:17:00,100
"Yes, I feel very sorry for them"

875
01:17:00,870 --> 01:17:04,400
"It kills a lot of young people, this heroin"

876
01:17:05,850 --> 01:17:10,520
"Yes, but it isn't going to kill my daughter"

877
01:17:11,870 --> 01:17:14,370
"She isn't going to die now"

878
01:17:15,970 --> 01:17:18,150
Anna took Sarah's hand

879
01:17:19,300 --> 01:17:24,370
"So thank you again Inspector Aziz and Mr Chen"

880
01:17:25,320 --> 01:17:26,320
"And goodbye"

881
01:17:27,720 --> 01:17:33,470
"Now I'm going to have a long cold drink, in a quiet garden"

882
01:17:33,470 --> 01:17:37,170
"With my daughter, and her new young man"

883
01:17:38,300 --> 01:17:41,950
"I want to know a lot more about him"

884
01:17:43,270 --> 01:17:48,500
Hassan stood with his mother and father near the door of the court

885
01:17:50,100 --> 01:17:54,100
Anna Harland put her hand on her daughter's arm

886
01:17:54,470 --> 01:17:56,370
And smiled at them

887
01:17:56,370 --> 01:18:10,160
The end
