Chapter 2

00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:15,500
The dog and his shadow

3
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:37,070
A dog once had a nice piece of meat for his dinner

4
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:43,580
He was walking along with the meat in his mouth as happy as a king

5
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:47,660
On his way home, there was a stream

6
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:53,200
The dog stopped to look into the calm, clear, water

7
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:56,360
What did the dog see in the water?

8
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:03,060
He saw a dog looking up at him

9
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,780
This dog looked the same as our happy little dog

10
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:12,380
And even had a similar piece of meat in its mouth

11
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:17,300
"I'll try to get that meat too" said the dog

12
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:24,200
But as soon as he tried to bite the new piece of meat

13
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:30,040
His own meat fell out of his mouth and into the stream

14
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:37,300
Then he saw that the other dog in the water had lost his piece too

15
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,400
He went sadly home

16
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:45,660
That day he only had his dreams to eat

17
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:55,610
Be careful of losing something you have for something that may not exist

18
00:01:56,970 --> 00:01:59,230

19
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,490
Belling the cat

20
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:10,920
One day all the mice came together to talk about the cat

21
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:17,360
"We must think of a plan to get away from it" said one old mouse

22
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:23,440
"It has eaten too many of us, so what shall we do?"

23
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:29,820
At last one proud young mouse stood up

24
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:34,060
"You know my brothers" said the young mouse

25
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:41,130
"The cat movies very quietly, we do not hear it quickly enough to escape"

26
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:44,880
"Let's tie a bell around the cat's neck"

27
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:49,120
"Then we can hear it coming and run away"

28
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,760
"Yeah" shouted all the mice

29
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:57,420
"Our smart young friend has thought of an excellent plan"

30
00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:00,440
"Let's go and buy a bell"

31
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:06,900
But just then an old mouse spoke:

32
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:11,240
"Wait a minute" said the wise old mouse

33
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:17,920
"Your plan is very good, but who will tie the bell on the cat?"

34
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:23,540
Then each mouse looked at another and they all said:

35
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:27,200
"Right, who?"

36
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:36,660
It is easy to suggest difficult things, but it is hard to do them

37
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,460
----

38
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,960
The hare and the tortoise

39
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:52,180
One day a hare was making fun of a tortoise for being so slow

40
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:57,960
"You think I am slow?" said the tortoise

41
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:03,980
"Let's run a race, and I bet that I will win"

42
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:10,140
"Oh really?" answered the hare "Let's try and see"

43
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:19,120
Soon the hare and the tortoise agreed that the fox would be the judge for their race

44
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:29,000
On race day, both the hare and the tortoise met the fox at the starting line

45
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,820
Both started off together

46
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:36,700
Soon the hare was far ahead of the slow tortoise

47
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:41,300
The hare thought she could stop and take a rest

48
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:48,360
She found some nice comfortable grass to rest in, and was soon in a deep sleep

49
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:53,360
Meanwhile the tortoise kept going and going

50
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:56,980
He was slow but he never stopped

51
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:02,560
After a nice long sleep, the hare woke up

52
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:08,360
But there was a problem, she slept for too long

53
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:15,580
She jumped up and ran as fast as she could, but it was too late

54
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:20,260
The tortoise had already crossed the finish line

55
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:27,920
Slow and steady wins the race

56
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:31,260
----

57
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:34,460
The Stag at the Lake

58
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:42,760
One very hot day, a tall strong stag stopped to drink from a clear lake

59
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:48,900
When he took a drink he could see his image in the water

60
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:53,340
"My horns are so beautiful" he said

61
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:56,920
"They're so strong and graceful"

62
00:05:56,920 --> 00:06:04,140
"But I'm still sad, because my legs are so thin and ugly"

63
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:11,100
At that moment, a lion came through the forest

64
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:14,220
And try to jump on the stag

65
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:19,040
The stag ran away very very fast

66
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:22,960
The ugly legs helped him run away

67
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:27,660
But the lion didn't stop following the stag

68
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:34,120
Soon the stag ran into the forest

69
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:38,510
But the forest was very thick, with many trees

70
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:42,540
His beautiful horns got caught in the branches

71
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:49,130
He tried to pull away, but he couldn't because of the long horns

72
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:54,970
Finally the lion caught up with the stag and killed him

73
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:04,480
People often forget what is really important in our lives

74
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:08,000
----

75
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:12,540
The country mouse and the city mouse

76
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:19,460
One day a city mouse went to visit his friend in the country

77
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:25,160
The country mouse was very glad to see his good friend

78
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:31,040
He give his guest the best dinner that he could find

79
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:37,180
The country mouse was afraid that there was not enough food for two

80
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:41,100
So he just ate a little piece of corn

81
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:48,600
His friend had some green peas, a piece of new cheese, and a ripe, red apple

82
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:55,290
After the city mouse ate all the dinner

83
00:07:55,480 --> 00:08:01,080
He said "How can you live in the country my friend?"

84
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:06,990
"You can see nothing but forest, rivers, fields, and mountains"

85
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:12,890
"You must be very tired of hearing nothing but bird songs"

86
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:21,760
"Come with me to the city, there you can live in a beautiful house"

87
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:25,580
"And have good things for dinner everyday"

88
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:29,390
"When you have lived in the city for a week"

89
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:33,930
"You will forget all about living in the country"

90
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:37,560
So the two mice went to the city

91
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:44,490
They reached the home of the city mouse at night

92
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:48,700
"You must be hungry, we walked for a long time"

93
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:51,480
said the city mouse to his friend

94
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:55,400
"We will have some dinner immediately"

95
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:01,040
So they went to the dinning room

96
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:05,130
And the city mouse found some cake and fruit

97
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:11,500
"Help yourself" he said "There is enough for both of us"

98
00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:16,460
"This is a very good dinner" said the country mouse

99
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,720
"You're very rich, my friend"

100
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:25,370
"Just then the door opened and the dog came in"

101
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:32,250
The mice jumped off the table, and ran into a hole in the floor

102
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:36,810
The poor little country mouse was so frightened

103
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:44,360
"Do not be afraid" said his friend "the dog cannot come in here"

104
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:50,190
Then the mice went to the kitchen

105
00:09:50,410 --> 00:09:55,920
They found an apple pie on the shelf, and were enjoying a piece of it

106
00:09:56,540 --> 00:10:01,690
At that moment they saw two bright eyes watching them

107
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:06,640
"The cat! The cat!" cried the city mouse

108
00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:11,090
And the mice quickly ran through a hole in the wall

109
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:17,800
When the country mouse could speak, he said:

110
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:24,240
"Goodbye my friend, you can live in the city with the dogs and cats"

111
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,440
"I like my home in the country"

112
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:37,180
"In the country, the birds sing to me, while I eat my simple corn and apples"

113
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:43,520
"In the city, the cats watch you eating your fancy cake, and pie"

114
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:49,640
"I like my corn in safety better than your cake in fear"

115
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:57,520
Better a simple meal in peace, than a fancy meal in fear

116
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:09,520
The end
